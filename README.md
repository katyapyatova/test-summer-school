# This piece of code allows to analyse protein design output in terms of energy scores. Proteins are designed to bind to a predetrmined site on the surface of CD45 receptor. Their energy of binding (ddG), binding area (SASA), 'protein-likeness' (number of hydrogen bonds, unsatisfied hydrogen bonds) and so on are evaluated by Rosetta software. 
# The code collects scores and pdb files from the output folder and plots the scores. The socre distributions are further used for filtering of potentially good binders.
